Overview
---

When we drive, we use our eyes to decide where to go.  The lines on the road that show us where the lanes are act as our constant reference for where to steer the vehicle.  Naturally, one of the first things we would like to do in developing a self-driving car is to automatically detect lane lines using an algorithm.

In this project it will detect lane lines in images using Python and OpenCV.  OpenCV means "Open-Source Computer Vision", which is a package that has many useful tools for analyzing images. 

## Pipeline description 
---

The following techniques are used:
* canndy edge detection
* region of interest selection
* hough transform line detection

### Conversion to grayscale

Applies the Grayscale transform, this will return an image with only one color channel

### Gaussian blurring

To supress noise and spurious gradients Gaussian smoothing is applied. By experiments, kernel of size 5 was chosen. 

### Edge detection
## Conclution
---

My pipeline consisted of 5 steps. First, I converted the images to grayscale, then I use gaussian fitler to blur the image and eliminate the noise.Nextly,I use Canny Edge Detection to extract lines in the image.Then  I define the interested region, and make the region out of the interested region to black.Then,I transform the image to Hough Space to fine the Lane lines.Finally,I add the the image which has beeb processed to the original image.
In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines() function by separating line segments by their slope ((y2-y1)/(x2-x1)) to decide which segments are part of the left line vs. the right line.  Then, I average the position of each of the lines and extrapolate to the top and bottom of the lane.Finally, I make a two line through the top and bottom of the lane respectively.
But the code can only work in good condition,and the region and other parameters are constant,which will result in error when work in complex enviroment.So the code is unstable.
